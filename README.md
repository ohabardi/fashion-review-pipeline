# Fashion Review Recommendation - ML Pipeline Project

## Project Summary
This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a customer would recommend a product based on review text and other features like age and product category. Built as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

## Key Features
- Preprocessing of numeric, categorical, and text data
- NLP-based feature engineering (review length, sentiment, adjective count)
- Full scikit-learn pipeline using ColumnTransformer and RandomForestClassifier
- Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV
- Model evaluation with classification report and confusion matrix

## Files
- `fashion_pipeline.ipynb`: Final notebook
- `reviews.csv`: Input dataset (or link if not included)
- `README.md`: Project description

## How to Run
Open the notebook and run all cells. Dataset should be placed in the same directory or adjusted accordingly in the code.
